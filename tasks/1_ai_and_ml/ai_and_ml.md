# AI & Machine Learning in Game Dev
## What's AI & ML

Keep in mind that when we are talking their capabilities is like how we (human) think and communicating with ourself. AI represents our behaviour in every action we did in our daily-basis. Machine Learning is a sub-set of AI concept that developed to teach machine how to **process specific task and give the accurate results as we want**.
In the making, we need to feed them (AI & ML) flow/data/pattern since we want to get specific results.

## Understanding a map of AI & ML

There are several popular approaches of AI & ML that help us now. In the *figure 1*, we see the AI is the parent of ML and Rule-based.

- **Rule-based** is an traditional AI approach used in several technologies, for an instance: Chat Bot, Email Spam Filtering, etc. A **rule-based** system must be supplied with a pattern in order to achieve what we want.
  
  Take an example of Chat Bot, if we have a bussiness and we want to sell our products, we need to collect the details from our customer such as: which product that they choose, payment method, name, address, etc. Using Chat Bot is a good solution. Consumer won't be asked stressful questions, you won't face unformatted answers, and it can be converted a well-detailed order format as your consumer have done the process.

  A **rule-based** system would determine what's next action/event that fired by the client through translating the action/event with predefined conditional case that you have already setup. This done by only using your custom flow, there's no special pattern & data that system should learn.

- Unlike **Rule-based** that you need to define the flow completely as well as only some cases that can be handled, **Machine Learning** can handle many recurring tasks and problems. Nowadays, you can ask your phone by speaking to play music for you. In this case, this can be done by ML system that has already trained with: understanding about human behaviour, songs database, etc.
